 * function below.

/*
 * This function returns string s1 if string s2 is an empty string, or
 * if s2 is not found in s1. If s2 is found in s1, the function
 * returns a new null-terminated string whose contents are identical
 * to s1, except that all occurrences of s2 in the original string s1
 * are, in the new string, replaced by the string s3. The caller owns
 * the new string.
 *
 * Strings s1, s2, and s3 must all be null-terminated strings. If any
 * of s1, s2, or s3 are NULL, the function returns NULL, indicating an
 * error condition. If any other error occurs, the function returns
 * NULL.
 *
 * This code is written pedantically, primarily so that asserts can be
 * used liberally. The code could certainly be optimized and/or made
 * less verbose, and I encourage you to do that if you use strstr in
 * your production code, once you're comfortable that it functions as
 * intended. Each assert makes plain an invariant condition that is
 * assumed to be true by the statement(s) that immediately follow the
 * assert.  Some of the asserts are trivially true, as written, but
 * they're included, nonetheless, in case you, in the process of
 * optimizing or adapting the code for your own purposes, make a
 * change that breaks an assumption made downstream by the original
 * code.
